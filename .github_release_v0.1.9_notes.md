# OpenClaw WORKSPACE_GOVERNANCE v0.1.9

## What is included

1. Core prompt quality fix (Bootstrap SSOT): removed mojibake/garbled symbols and normalized command/list formatting.
2. README cross-link alignment: GitHub pages now include direct ClawHub listing links (EN + 繁中).
3. Handbook alignment: distribution channels are explicitly mapped (Plugin + ClawHub listing).
4. Version alignment for release channels: package/plugin metadata updated to `0.1.9`.

## Why this release matters

1. Reduces instruction ambiguity caused by corrupted symbols in core governance prompt text.
2. Improves onboarding discovery flow with bidirectional GitHub <-> ClawHub navigation.
3. Keeps release channels consistent for operators and new users.

## Upgrade

```bash
openclaw plugins install @adamchanadam/openclaw-workspace-governance@latest
openclaw plugins enable openclaw-workspace-governance
```

Then in OpenClaw:

```text
/gov_setup check
/gov_setup upgrade
/gov_migrate
/gov_audit
```

(If slash routing is unstable, use `/skill ...` fallback.)
